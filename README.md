# Data Weather Pipeline

## Project Overview
The Data Weather Pipeline is designed to collect, process, and analyze weather data from various sources. This pipeline automates the retrieval of weather information, transforms it into a usable format, and loads it into a database for further analysis. The project leverages [mention the tools, libraries, or frameworks used, e.g., Python, Apache Airflow, etc.].

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Automatically fetches weather data from APIs or public datasets.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and transforms raw weather data into a structured format.
- **Database Loading**: Loads the processed data into a database for easy access and analysis.
- **Scheduled Runs**: Supports scheduled execution to keep data up to date.

## Workflow
1. **Extract**: Fetch raw weather data from specified sources (APIs, CSV files, etc.).
2. **Transform**: Clean and format the data, handling missing values and conversions as needed.
3. **Load**: Insert the transformed data into a database for analysis and reporting.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kloggenberg/data-weather-pipeline.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd data-weather-pipeline
    ```

3. [Include any additional installation steps like setting up a virtual environment or installing dependencies, e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`.]

## Usage
To run the pipeline:
```bash
